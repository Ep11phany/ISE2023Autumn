# Team-work Proposal

## Evidence of user need

We think AI can help solve searching images by its semantics, because AI can assist people in searching images by semantics through a technology called "content-based image retrieval" (CBIR). This technology relies on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to understand and analyze the visual content of images, making it easier for users to find images based on their semantic meaning rather than just textual descriptions or tags.
AI algorithms can be trained using deep learning models to understand the semantic meaning of images. By processing large amounts of labeled images, these models learn to associate visual features with specific objects, scenes, or concepts. The numerical representations generated by AI algorithms can also be used to build a semantic index or database. This index links the visual features to their corresponding semantic labels.
When a user enters a search query (which could be a description, keyword, or even an image), the AI system analyzes the query to understand its semantics. It then retrieves images from the database that closely match the semantic meaning of the query. The retrieved images are ranked based on their relevance to the query, usually using similarity metrics. The most relevant images are then presented to the user in the search results.
Overall, AI facilitates semantic image search by automating the analysis of image content and understanding the meaning behind it. This leads to more efficient and intuitive image search experiences for users.

## Augmentation versus automation

**Augmentation**: speed up retrieving (scenario: search a meme with certain meaning when chatting, emphasizing real-time capability)

**Automation**: (search engine/chatting) needed almost everytime

## Design your reward function

Our AI model will be optimized for reward because this task returns a set of images(can be ranked by fitness score), and user needs to choose the one that fits its demand the most; so we are more focused on whether the demanded image is included in the final set of the output rather than how much proportion of the wrong-predicted images are there in the output set.
We understand that the tradeoff for choosing this method means our model will perform not so well on the first-match rate, which means the rate of the first-ranked image satisfying the demand of the user.

## Define success criteria

- Success metric:

IF {the satisfaction rate of the first 5/10 returned images}
FOR {semantic image retrieving}
{drops below} {80%}
WE WILL {fine-tune CLIP model}
